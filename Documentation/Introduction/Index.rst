============
Introduction
============

This extension provides the third party database integration tool »rsrq« integrated and preconfigured for the TYPO3 installation and database. 
The extension is PHP 7.4 compatible. It is greatly inspired by the existing extension wfqbe, which unfortunately is no longer maintained and 
does not work for the newer TYPO3 versions. The extension is completely rebuild and is now based on Extbase and Fluid.
