What does it do?
----------------

This extension allows you to connect to a table in the current DBMS and to insert, update, delete, search or retrieve data from this table. 
The extension provides you with two different plugins. These plugins allow you to:

*  create a query for retrieving data in a List (table) format
*  create a search form for searching in an existing query
*  create a module to insert, edit data into a specific table or delete specific data from the table
*  create links to detailed pages

All the FE outputs are template based, this means that it is possible to create a custom template (f.i. on fileadmin) to show your query results. 
The templates are fully fluid based, so it is relative easy to extend or change them.
