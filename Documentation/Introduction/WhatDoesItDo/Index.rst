What does it do?
----------------

This extension allows you to connect to a table in the current DBMS and to insert, search or retrieve data from this table. The
extension provides you with two different plugins. The plugins allow you to:

*  create a query for retrieving data in a List (table) format
*  create a search form for searching in an existing query
*  create a module to insert, edit data into a specific table or delete specific data from the table

All the FE outputs are template based, this means that it is possible to create a custom template to show your query results. 
The template are fully fluid based, so it is relative easy to extend or change them.
Event management and registration is an extension for TYPO3 CMS to manage events and registrations.
