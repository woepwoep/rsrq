Once we have a list of characters and are able to search (filter) the output, we would like to change existing data. Hence the name CUD: **C** reate, **U** pdate and **D** elete data in the database.
This is one of the most powerful features of the extension. 
To enable this function, create a page in the pagetree that contains the CUD-plugin.
On this page, fill in the table that should be accessed.
